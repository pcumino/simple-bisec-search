# Simple bisection square root
This is a yet simple square root function based on bisection search algorithm.
It written in Matlab language.

**Usage:**

    [ans, tries] = sqrtBisec(x, y);
Where `x` is the value to be calculated and `y` is the result precision.
The result is given by `ans` and the number of guesses to find the answer if given by `tries`.
